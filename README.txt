Make sure you have a version of python and an IDE for it installed

Install pip here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

Run the following commands in your command prompt once pip is installed:
	pip install tensorflow
	pip install numpy
	pip install pandas
Open up main.py in your ide and follow along!

Can also find the version of the py file I used here:
